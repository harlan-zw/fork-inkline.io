# Design System
## Install Inkline using the official JSDelivr CDN integration. The content delivery network (CDN) provides super fast asset delivery from a server that is closest to you.

### Starter Template

To quickly test Inkline, copy the code below into your `index.html` or try it out live on <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/alexgrozav/0dknfs6L/" rel="nofollow">JSFiddle</a>. This will pull the latest version of Vue and Inkline, allowing you to start playing around with Vue and Inkline's components.

Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards, using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behavior.
