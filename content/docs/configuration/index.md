# Configuration
## Inkline comes with hundreds of powerful configuration options to make the Design System truly your own.

### Theme Options

Inkline now supports a powerful and flexible **`inkline.config.ts`** theme configuration file using [@inkline/config](https://github.com/inkline/config), our cutting-edge CSS/Sass code generator. 

This allows you to quickly and easily generate a comprehensive set of CSS variables for your Vue.js 3 Design System. With its intuitive interface and advanced features, you can easily customize your website's design and layout to suit your needs.

### Plugin Options

You can customize the default behavior of the UI Library components by passing in options to the plugin. These options allow you to tailor the components to your specific needs and preferences, giving you more control over the look and functionality of your website.
